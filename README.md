### SoundCloud API Java Client
A work-in-progress client for the SoundCloud HTTP API written in Java.

This project is a layer over the SoundCloud [java-api-wrapper](https://github.com/soundcloud/java-api-wrapper) that allows you to work directly with SoundCloud entities as opposed to the raw JSON.
